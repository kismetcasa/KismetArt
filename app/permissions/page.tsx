// their collections are mint-ready (smart wallet has ADMIN) vs need a
// one-time retroactive Authorize click. Closes the discoverability
// gap that left users hitting AUTHORIZE_REQUIRED on the first mint
// into a legacy collection without prior warning.
//
// Server-component shell — actual UX is client-side because it depends
// on the connected wallet's tracked collections + on-chain perms reads.
