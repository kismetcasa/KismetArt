/**
 * Public read of an address's Pass-collection validity. The profile
 * Collected tab overlays a "Valid Pass" badge on tokens from the
 * configured passCollection so the holder can confirm at a glance that
 * their Pass currently grants mint access (see ProfileView + MomentCard).
 *
 * Returns the configured `passCollection` so callers can match it against
 * a moment's collection address before rendering the badge — moments
 * from any other collection have no validity to display.
 *
 * Reads the stored ledger (`getValidBalance`) rather than running live
 * on-chain reconciliation (`hasValidPass`) — the badge can lag behind
 * actual on-chain state by up to one webhook delivery cycle, but reads
 * are cheap and the actual gate decision (mint enforcement) still runs
 * the live read. So the badge is eventually-consistent UX; policy stays
 * correct.
 *
 * Rate-limited 60/min/IP to bound enumeration probing.
