/**
 * Records an airdrop after the on-chain tx submitted by the user's wallet
 * lands. Companion to `useAirdrop` — the form fires this after
 * `writeContractAsync` resolves so two display surfaces stay populated:
 *
 *   1. ProfileView's airdrops section (read via GET /api/airdrops)
 *   2. Recipient inboxes (one notification per recipient, type=airdrop)
 *
 * Inprocess's `/api/airdrops` is no longer authoritative for Kismet — we
 * bypass their relay to call Zora's `adminMint` directly, so they never see
 * the airdrop. This endpoint is the local replacement.
 *
 * On-chain verification + idempotency: every claim is verified against the
 * Transfer events on the supplied txHash before any side effect runs, and
 * a (txHash, collection, tokenId, sender) tuple is locked into Redis NX so
 * an attacker who observes a real airdrop tx can't replay it to drain the
 * sender's airdrop quota or pollute their notification log. The chain is
 * the source of truth — body fields that disagree with the receipt fail.
