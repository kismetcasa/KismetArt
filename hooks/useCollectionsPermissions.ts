 * Phase 3 — resolves the connected user's inprocess smart wallet, then
 * batch-reads permissions(0, smartWallet) for every collection in the
 * provided list. Surfaces which existing collections need a retroactive
 * Authorize click before they can mint via the inprocess relay (the
 * "ensure already-created collections survive" requirement).
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *   - Uses wagmi's useReadContracts (plural). Under the hood viem will
 *     batch via Multicall when supported, so a user with N collections
 *     pays roughly the cost of one RPC round-trip (Base supports
 *     multicall3 by default).
 *   - Reads the connected EOA via useAccount, resolves it through
 *     useInprocessSmartWallet (cached + deduped per EOA across the
 *     app so adjacent surfaces don't double-fetch).
 *   - Failed reads (RPC blip, contract not deployed yet, etc.) yield
 *     hasAdmin=null so callers can render an "unknown" state instead of
 *     a false-negative warning. RPC flake should never look like
 *     missing permissions.
 *   - The query is gated on having BOTH a smart wallet AND a non-empty
 *     valid address list. Without those, returns an empty map and
 *     loading=false (idle state).
 *
 * Caller pattern (e.g. MintForm picker dropdown):
 *
 *   const { byAddress, missingCount } = useCollectionsPermissions(
 *     userCollections.map((c) => c.address),
 *   )
 *   const status = byAddress[c.address.toLowerCase()]
 *   if (status?.hasAdmin === false) showWarningBadge()
