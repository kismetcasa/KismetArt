/**
 * Anchor for the persistent shared video element. Renders an empty div
 * at the position/size the video should occupy; the SharedVideoProvider
 * CSS-positions a managed <video> element to overlay it.
 *
 * Acquire lifecycle:
 *   - controls=true (lightbox, detail page): acquire immediately on
 *     mount so the route-transition morph from card → overlay is
 *     instant. Releases on unmount; provider grace timer (1s) keeps
 *     the element alive long enough for the previous surface (e.g.
 *     the card we morphed from) to re-claim it without re-decoding.
 *   - controls=false (feed cards): lazy-acquire via IntersectionObserver
 *     with a 300px rootMargin. Without this, every card on the
 *     homepage triggered an immediate `<video>` element creation +
 *     Arweave HTTP request on mount; with 18 cards on page 1 that's
 *     18 simultaneous fetches, queued past Safari's 6-per-host
 *     connection cap and causing videos near the bottom of the page
 *     to spend seconds waiting in the HTTP queue before they could
 *     even start loading. Lazy-acquire keeps the network + decoder
 *     budget proportional to what's actually near the screen.
 *
 * On every acquire we attach a ResizeObserver (for slot size changes)
 * and scroll listeners on each clipping ancestor (their scroll events
 * aren't covered by the provider's centralised window-scroll handler,
 * since ancestor sets vary per slot). All of that gets torn down on
 * release so an off-screen slot has zero ongoing cost.
