// /api/moment, /api/featured/collections-hydrated, and search (moments +
// collections). New mints into a hidden collection are automatically hidden
// because the filter resolves at read time; unhiding the collection
// restores everything except moments that were independently hide-marked
// (those keep their per-moment hide, which is treated as a stronger signal).
