/**
 * Per-address content visibility filter. Hides every public-feed entry
 * authored by a listed address — moments (filtered by creator),
 * collections (filtered by artist), listings (filtered by seller),
 * featured rows, search results. The user's own profile still surfaces
 * their content TO THEMSELVES (and to admin) so they can manage it;
 * the filter only excludes from third-party-visible feeds.
 *
 * Distinct from main's hiddenCollections / hiddenMoments:
 *   - Those are per-content (one address can have some content visible
 *     and some hidden, set by the creator themselves or by admin).
 *   - This is per-author (everything the address produces is hidden, set
 *     only by admin).
 *
 * Distinct from lib/blacklist:
 *   - The action blacklist blocks the address from PERFORMING actions
 *     (mint, list, airdrop). It doesn't hide their existing content.
 *   - This list HIDES their existing content but doesn't block new
 *     actions. Blacklist + hide together = full ban.
 *
 * Admin is exempt at both read and write so an accidental self-listing
 * can't hide admin's content from the admin's own views.
 *
 * Memoization mirrors lib/hiddenCollections — 60s TTL with own-pod
 * invalidate() on every write so the next read after a hide/unhide
 * reflects the change immediately on the same pod.
