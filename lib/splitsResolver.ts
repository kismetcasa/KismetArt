 *      exactly one `CreateSplit` per split contract).
 *   2. Reading the originating transaction calldata.
 *   3. Decoding against `createSplit(address[], uint32[], uint32, address)`.
 *
 * Returns null on any failure (RPC error, no log found, calldata didn't
 * decode as `createSplit` — e.g. the split was deployed via a contract
 * that wraps SplitMain). Callers should treat null as "couldn't resolve"
 * and fall through to whatever behavior they had before.
