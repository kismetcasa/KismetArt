 * Returns the subset of `candidates` where `viewer` holds at least one
 * mint-capable bit (MINTER or ADMIN) at tokenId 0 (collection-wide).
 *
 * Implementation: one `getLogs` call across every candidate, topic-
 * filtered by indexed `tokenId=0` and `user=viewer`. Each addPermission
 * / removePermission emits the user's full new bitmap, so the latest
 * event per collection is authoritative — sort by (blockNumber,
 * logIndex), keep only those with the mint mask set.
 *
 * Why not per-collection `permissions(0, viewer)` reads: that's N
 * RPC calls; this is one. Public RPCs can rate-limit on big address
 * arrays, but our paid Base RPC handles the union fine, and we're
 * naturally bounded by the size of `getTrackedCollections()`.
 *
 * Excludes ADMIN-bit holders who are themselves the collection's
 * defaultAdmin (creator) — that's handled at the call site, not here,
 * because a creator's KV entry already comes back via
 * `/api/collections?artist=…`.
